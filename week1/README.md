WEEK 0 problems

Week 0 was relatively easy and doable. I did not struggle wih much and it felt more like a refresher for the bootcamp

Confident in:
Creating and calling functions, user input, string methods, creating github repositories and pushing to them

Weak point:
Still familiarizing myself with gitlab
